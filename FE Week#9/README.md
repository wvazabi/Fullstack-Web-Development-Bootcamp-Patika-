# Sport-Center Web Development Project

## Overview

This project is a showcase of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript concepts learned in the Patika+ Full Stack Web Development program. It features a responsive and interactive webpage designed to enhance user experience across different devices.

## Features

- **Our Classes Section**: All buttons under the "Our Classes" section are fully functional, with images for each sport included in the documentation.
  
- **Our Best Trainers**: The last image in this section acts as a hover preview for the other content. Each of the three items responds to hover events, with the third image serving as an example for hover effects.

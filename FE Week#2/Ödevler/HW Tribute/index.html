        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 â€“ March 15, 1937) was an American writer of weird and horror fiction,
            who is known for his creation of what became the Cthulhu Mythos.</p>
        <p>Lovecraft was virtually unknown during his lifetime and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty,
            but he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Among his most celebrated tales are "The Call of Cthulhu",
            "At the Mountains of Madness", and "The Shadow over Innsmouth", all canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos.</p>
        <p>Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Lovecraft spent most of his life in New England.
            In 1913, he wrote a critical letter to a pulp magazine that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction. During his lifetime,
            Lovecraft was virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before dying in poverty,
            but he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre.</p>
        <p>Lovecraft's writing, particularly the so-called Cthulhu Mythos, has inspired a vast body of literature,
            and an entire subgenre of horror and fantastic fiction has grown up around the central themes of his work:
            the limitations of human knowledge and the fundamentally alien nature of the universe. Lovecraft's stories are often structured as narratives of cosmic revelation,
            wherein characters confront the insignificance of humanity and the horrors of the unknowable.</p>
        <p>Despite his relatively obscure literary career during his lifetime, Lovecraft's reputation has grown posthumously.
            He is now regarded as one of the most influential writers in the horror genre, with his works continuing to inspire writers, filmmakers, and artists worldwide.</p>
        <p>Lovecraft was a prolific letter writer, and his correspondences with other writers and fans of his work are a significant part of his legacy.
            These letters reveal much about his thoughts on writing, the nature of horror, and his philosophy of life. Lovecraft's work has also influenced popular culture, including music, games, and even occultism, making his legacy both broad and profound.</p>
